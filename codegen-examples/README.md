# Codegen Examples

[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-docs.codegen.com-blue)](https://docs.codegen.com)

This is a collection of examples using [Codegen](https://codegen.com). You can use these examples to learn how to use Codegen and build custom code transformations.

## Setup

We recommend using [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) with Python 3.13 for the best experience.

To install Codegen, please follow the [official installation guide](https://docs.codegen.com/introduction/installation). Once Codegen is installed, use these steps to run the examples in this repository:

Install the Codegen CLI globally
```bash
uv tool install codegen
```

Initialize Codegen in your project
```bash
codegen init
```

Activate the virtual environment
```bash
source .codegen/.venv/bin/activate
```

Your environment is now ready to run example codemods.

### IDE Configuration (Optional)

To configure your IDE for optimal use with Codegen, follow our [IDE setup guide](https://docs.codegen.com/introduction/ide-usage#configuring-your-ide-interpreter).

## Examples

Within the examples folder, each subdirectory contains a self-contained example with:
- An explanation of the transformation (`README.md`)
- A Codegen script that performs the transformation (`run.py`)
- Sample code to transform, if not using a repository (`input_repo/`)

To see a transformation, simply run the `run.py` script within the desired directory.
