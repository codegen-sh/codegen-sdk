The `expert` command gives you direct access to Codegen's AI expert, which is specifically trained to help with codemods, visualizations, and Codegen's APIs.

## Usage

```bash
codegen expert --query "your question here"
```

## Options

- `--query`, `-q`: The question to ask the expert

## Examples

Ask about a specific API:
```bash
codegen expert -q "How do I use codebase.find_function() to locate all async functions?"
```

Get help with a transformation:
```bash
codegen expert -q "What's the best way to rename a function and all its references?"
```

Ask about best practices:
```bash
codegen expert -q "What's the recommended way to handle error cases in codemods?"
```

## Use Cases

The expert is particularly helpful for:
- Understanding Codegen's APIs and capabilities
- Getting guidance on codemod implementation strategies
- Learning best practices for code transformations
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Finding the right approach for complex refactoring tasks

<Note>
The expert has deep knowledge of Codegen's internals and common transformation patterns. For general programming questions, consider using standard AI assistants instead.
