The `update` command is designed to help you manage the version of Codegen installed on your system. Whether you want to update to the latest version or switch to a specific version, this command offers a streamlined way to do so. Additionally, you can list all supported versions available on PyPI.

```bash
codegen update [OPTIONS]
```

## Usage

```bash
codegen update [OPTIONS]
```

## Options

- `--list, -l`: List all supported versions of Codegen.
  When used, the command fetches the available releases from PyPI, filters them to display a range of versions (typically including the current version and a few preceding minor versions), and highlights the current version in the output.

- `--version, -v`: Update to a specific version of Codegen (e.g., `2.1.0`).
  This option enables you to target a particular version rather than updating to the latest available release.

## Examples

Update Codegen to the latest version:
```bash
codegen update
```

List all supported versions of Codegen:
```bash
codegen update --list
```

Update Codegen to a specific version:
```bash
codegen update --version 2.1.0
```

## Execution Flow

When you run the `update` command, the following steps occur:

1. **Retrieve Current Version:**
   The command retrieves the current version of Codegen by accessing package metadata.

2. **Option Handling:**
   - **Listing Versions:**
     If you use the `--list` flag, the command fetches all available releases from PyPI, filters them based on a defined range (typically covering future versions and a couple of previous minor versions), and prints the list with the current version highlighted.

   - **Specific Version Update:**
     If the `--version` option is provided, the command installs the specified version by invoking `pip install` with the exact version (e.g., `pip install codegen==2.1.0`).

   - **Default Update:**
     If no options are provided, the command updates Codegen to the latest version using `pip install --upgrade`.

3. **Error Handling:**
   The command checks for mutually exclusive options. If both `--list` and `--version` are specified simultaneously, an error is raised.

<Note>
Ensure you use either `--list` or `--version` when running the update command, not both.
