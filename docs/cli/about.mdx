The Codegen CLI helps you:

- Initialize Codegen in your repository
- Create and run codemods
- Work with AI assistance

<Note>
  For installation instructions, see our [Getting
  Started](/introduction/getting-started) guide.
</Note>

## Getting Started

1. **Initialize Codegen** in your repository:

```bash
codegen init
```

2. **Create your first codemod**:

```bash
codegen create my-codemod --description "What you want to accomplish"
```

The `--description` flag enables AI assistance to help generate your codemod. Be as specific as possible about what you want to achieve.

## Working with AI

When using Cursor, you can mention `@codegen-sh` in any chat or composer window to get:

- Documentation about available APIs
- Context about your active codemod
- Examples of similar codemods
- Relevant code snippets

The AI uses this context to provide accurate and helpful responses about working with Codegen.
