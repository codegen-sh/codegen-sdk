The primary entrypoint to programs leveraging Codegen is the [Codebase](../api-reference/core/Codebase) class.

Construct a Codebase by passing in a path to a local `git` repository.



```python
from codegen import Codebase

# Parse from a local directory
codebase = Codebase("path/to/repository")

# Parse from current directory
codebase = Codebase("./")
```
<Note>This will automatically infer the programming language of the codebase and parse all files in the codebase.</Note>

<Tip>The initial parse may take a few minutes for large codebases. This pre-computation enables constant-time operations afterward. [Learn more here.](/introduction/how-it-works)</Tip>

## Supported Languages

Codegen currently supports:
- [Python](/api-reference/python)
- [TypeScript/JavaScript](/api-reference/javascript)
- [React/JSX](/building-with-codegen/react-and-jsx)
