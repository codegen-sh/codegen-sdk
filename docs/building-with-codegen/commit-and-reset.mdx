Codegen keeps changes in memory until explicitly written to disk. Two core APIs manage this state:

- [`Codebase.commit()`](/api-reference/core/Codebase#commit) - Commit changes to disk
- [`Codebase.reset()`](/api-reference/core/Codebase#reset) - Reset the codebase and filesystem to its initial state

## Committing Changes

When you make changes to your codebase through Codegen's APIs, they aren't immediately written to disk. You need to explicitly commit them with [`Codebase.commit()`](/api-reference/core/Codebase#commit):

```python
from codegen import Codebase

codebase = Codebase("./")

# Make some changes
file = codebase.get_file("src/app.py")
file.before("# ðŸŒˆ hello, world!")

# Changes aren't on disk yet
codebase.commit()  # Now they are!
```

This transaction-like behavior helps ensure your changes are atomic and consistent.

## Resetting State

The [`Codebase.reset()`](/api-reference/core/Codebase#reset) method allows you to revert the codebase to its initial state:

```python
# Make some changes
codebase.get_file("src/app.py").remove()
codebase.create_file("src/new_file.py", "x = 1")

# Check the changes
assert codebase.get_file("src/app.py", optional=True) is None
assert codebase.get_file("src/new_file.py") is not None

# Reset everything
codebase.reset()

# Changes are reverted
assert codebase.get_file("src/app.py") is not None
assert codebase.get_file("src/new_file.py", optional=True) is None
```

<Note>
  `reset()` reverts both the in-memory state and any uncommitted filesystem
  changes. However, it preserves your codemod implementation in
  `.codegen/codemods/`.
