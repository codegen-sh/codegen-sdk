# Function Decorator

The `function` decorator is used to define codegen functions within your application. It allows you to specify a name for the function that will be ran making it easier to run specific codemods

## Usage

To use the `function` decorator, simply annotate your function with `@codegen.function` and provide a name as an argument.

### Example

```python
@codegen.function('my-function')
def run(codebase):
    pass
```

In this example, the function `run` is decorated with `@codegen.function` and given the name `'my-function'`. This name will be used when the function is ran.

## Parameters

- `name` (str): The name of the function to be used when ran.

## Description

The `function` decorator is part of the codegen SDK CLI and is used to mark functions that are intended to be ran as part of a code generation process. It ensures that the function is properly registered and can be invoked with the specified name.


## CLI Examples

### Running a Function

To run a deployed function using the CLI, use the following command:

```bash
codegen run my-function
```

This command runs the function named `my-function`.
