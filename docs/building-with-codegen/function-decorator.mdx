# Function Decorator

The `function` decorator is used to define codegen functions within your application. It allows you to specify a name for the function that will be used when it is deployed. And ran in Codegen Cloud

## Usage

To use the `function` decorator, simply annotate your function with `@codegen.function` and provide a name as an argument.

### Example

```python
@codegen.function('my-function')
def run(codebase):
    pass
```

In this example, the function `run` is decorated with `@codegen.function` and given the name `'my-function'`. This name will be used when the function is deployed.

## Parameters

- `name` (str): The name of the function to be used when deployed.

## Description

The `function` decorator is part of the codegen SDK CLI and is used to mark functions that are intended to be deployed as part of a code generation process. It ensures that the function is properly registered and can be invoked with the specified name.


## CLI Examples

### Deploying a Function

To deploy a function using the CLI, use the following command:

```bash
codegen deploy my-function
```

This command deploys the function named `my-function` to the Codegen Cloud.

### Running a Function

To run a deployed function using the CLI, use the following command:

```bash
codegen run my-function
```

This command runs the function named `my-function` that has been deployed to the Codegen Cloud.
