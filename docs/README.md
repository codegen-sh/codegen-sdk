# Codegen Docs

## Development

From within the `docs/` subdirectory:

```bash
npm i -g mintlify
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

You should then get hot reloading. Also recommend installing the `MDX` extension for VSCode.

## Adding New Pages

- Edit the page as a `.mdx` doc
- Make sure to edit `mint.json` so it appears in the UI
