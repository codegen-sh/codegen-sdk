## Our Mission

Our mission is to build fully-autonomous software engineering - the equivalent of self-driving cars for code.

We believe the highest leverage path to autonomous development is enabling AI agents to "act via code."

Just as self-driving cars need sophisticated sensors and controls to navigate the physical world, AI agents need powerful, precise tools to manipulate codebases. We're building that foundational layer: a programmatic interface that lets AI agents express complex code transformations through code itself.

This approach creates a shared language that both humans and AI can use to:

- Express powerful changes with precision and predictability
- Build sophisticated tools from primitive operations
- Create and maintain their own abstractions
- Scale transformations across massive codebases

## The Team

Based in San Francisco, we're a team of engineers and researchers passionate about:

- Making large-scale code changes more accessible
- Building tools that work the way developers think
- Creating the infrastructure for AI-powered code manipulation
- Advancing the state of the art in program transformation

## Open Source

We believe in the power of open source software. Our core library, [codegen](https://github.com/codegen-sh/codegen-sdk), is freely available and open to contributions from the community.
