Codegen is designed to be used with AI assistants. This document describes how to use Codegen with common AI tools, including Copilot, Cursor, Devin and more.

## Codegen Playground

The [Codegen Playground](https://codegen.sh/playground) includes an integrated chat assistant purpose-built for generating Codegen programs.

<Tip>The playground is the easiest way to get up and running with Codegen.</Tip>

## Generating System Prompts

The [Codegen CLI](/cli/about) provides commands to generate `.md` files that can be fed to any AI assistant for more accurate and contextual help.

When you create a new codemod via [`codegen create`](/cli/create):

```bash
codegen create delete-dead-imports --description "Delete unused imports"
```

Codegen automatically generates an optimized ["system prompt"](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37880023) that includes:

- An introduction to Codegen
- Codegen API documentation
- Examples of relevant transformations

You can find this generated prompt in the `.codegen/prompts/<codemod-name>-system-prompt.md` file.

<Note>
  All contents of the `.codegen/prompts` directory are by default ignored the
  `.gitignore` file. after running [`codegen init`](/cli/init)
</Note>

This `.md` file can be used with any AI assistant (Claude, GPT-4, etc.) to get more accurate and contextual help.

## Example Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a codemod with description">
    Use the [`create` command](/cli/create) with a detailed description of what you want to accomplish:
    ```bash
    codegen create modernize-components --description "Convert class components to functional components with hooks"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review the generated system prompt">
    Check the AI context that Codegen generated for your transformation: ```bash
    cat codegen-sh/codemods/modernize-components/prompt.md ```
  </Step>

<Step title="Iterate in Copilot, Cursor or Windsurf">
  Reference your codemod when asking questions to get contextual help: ```
  @codegen-sh/codemods/modernize-components How should I handle
  componentDidMount? ```
</Step>

  <Step title="Get contextual help">
    The AI will understand you're working on React modernization and provide relevant suggestions about using useEffect hooks and other modern React patterns.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Copilot, Cursor and Windsurf (IDEs)

When using IDE chat assistants, you can leverage Codegen's context by mentioning your codemod in composer mode:

```bash
@.codegen/codemods/upgrade-react18 @.codegen/prompts/system-prompt.md
```

This will ensure that the IDE's native chat model is aware of the APIs and common patterns for Codegen.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Generated Prompts**: Let Codegen generate system prompts instead of writing them manually. They include important context about your codebase.

2. **Be Specific**: When creating a codemod, provide detailed descriptions to help the AI understand your goals:

   ```bash
   codegen create migrate-api --description "Update API calls to use the new v2 endpoints, handling pagination and error responses"
   ```

3. **Leverage Context**: In Cursor, always @mention your codemod to give the AI full context about your transformation.

4. **Iterative Refinement**: Use AI suggestions as a starting point, then refine based on your specific needs.

<Note>
  The system prompts are designed to be human-readable. Review them to
  understand what context is being provided to the AI.
</Note>

<Tip>
  You can also use the generated system prompts with other AI tools - just copy
  the prompt content and paste it into your preferred AI interface.
