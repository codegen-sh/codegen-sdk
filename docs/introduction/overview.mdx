[Codegen](https://github.com/codegen-sh/codegen-sdk) is a python library for manipulating codebases.

It provides a scriptable interface to a powerful, multi-lingual language server built on top of [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/).

export const intoSnippet = `# grabs codebase content

file = codebase.files[0] # or .get_file("test.py")
function = codebase.functions[0] # or .get_symbol("my_func")

# print logs

print(f'# of files: {len(codebase.files)}')
print(f'# of functions: {len(codebase.functions)}')

# make edits

file.edit('ðŸŒˆ' + file.content) # edit contents
function.rename('new_name') # rename
function.set_docstring('new docstring') # set docstring

# ... etc.

## Why Codegen?

Many software engineering tasks - refactors, enforcing patterns, analyzing control flow, etc. - are fundamentally programmatic operations. Yet the tools we use to express these transformations often feel disconnected from how we think about code.

Codegen was engineered backwards from real-world refactors we performed for enterprises at [Codegen, Inc.](/introduction/about). Instead of starting with theoretical abstractions, we built the set of APIs that map directly to how humans and AI think about code changes:

- **Natural Mental Model**: Express transformations through high-level operations that match how you reason about code changes, not low-level text or AST manipulation.
- **Clean Business Logic**: Let the engine handle the complexities of imports, references, and cross-file dependencies.
- **Scale with Confidence**: Make sweeping changes across large codebases consistently across Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, and React.

As AI becomes increasingly sophisticated, we're seeing a fascinating shift: AI agents aren't bottlenecked by their ability to understand code or generate solutions. Instead, they're limited by their ability to efficiently manipulate codebases. The challenge isn't the "brain" - it's the "hands."

We built Codegen with a key insight: future AI agents will need to ["act via code,"](https://voyager.minedojo.org/) building their own sophisticated tools for code manipulation. Rather than generating diffs or making direct text changes, these agents will:

1. Express transformations as composable programs
2. Build higher-level tools by combining primitive operations
3. Create and maintain their own abstractions for common patterns

This creates a shared language that both humans and AI can reason about effectively, making code changes more predictable, reviewable, and maintainable. Whether you're a developer writing a complex refactoring script or an AI agent building transformation tools, Codegen provides the foundation for expressing code changes as they should be: through code itself.
