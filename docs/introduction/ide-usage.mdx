Get up and running with Codegen programs in IDEs like VSCode, Cursor and PyCharm.

<Tip>Make sure to [install and initialize](/introduction/installation) Codegen with `codegen init`</Tip>

## Codegen Initialization

`cd` into your project's directory and initialize codegen with [codegen init](/cli/init).

This will create the following directory structure:

```bash
.codegen/
├── .venv/            # Python virtual environment (gitignored)
├── config.toml       # Project configuration
├── codemods/         # Your codemod implementations
├── jupyter/          # Jupyter notebooks for exploration
└── codegen-system-prompt.txt  # AI system prompt
```
<Note>This includes a codegen-specific python 3.13 `.venv`. Learn more about the [.codegen folder here](/building-with-codegen/dot-codegen) </Note>

<Tip>
This includes `codegen-system-prompt.txt`, a text file that will make IDE chat assistants fluent in Codegen. [Learn more here](/introduction/work-with-ai)
</Tip>


### Creating a New Codemod

Generate the boilerplate for a new code manipulation program using [codegen create](/cli/create):

```bash
codegen create organize-types \
  -d "Move all TypeScript types to \
      into a centralized types.ts file"
```

<Tip>
    Passing in `-d --description` will get an LLM expert to compose an initial version for you. This requires a Github account registered on [codegen.sh](https://codegen.sh)
</Tip>

This will:
1. Create a new codemod in `.codegen/codemods/organize_types/`
2. Generate a custom `system-prompt.txt` based on your task
3. Set up the basic structure for your program

<Note>
The generated codemod includes type hints and docstrings, making it easy to get IDE autocompletion and documentation.
</Note>

### Running Codemods

Once you've written your codemod, you can run it directly from the terminal:

```bash
codegen run organize-types
```

This will apply all changes locally to your filesystem.

<Tip>You can also run the program directly via `.codegen/.venv/bin/python path/to/codemod.py`</Tip>

### Viewing Changes

We recommend viewing changes in your IDE's native diff editor.

### Resetting Changes and Iteration

If any changes are incorrect, run the [codegen reset](/cli/reset) command to eliminate all unstaged changes, excluding the `.codegen` directory

```
codegen reset
```


## IDE Features

### Debugging

### Autocompletion and Type Hints

Codegen is built with IDE integration in mind:
- Full type hints for all APIs
- Detailed docstrings with examples
- Rich autocompletion support

<Tip>
Make sure your IDE's Python environment includes the `codegen` package for the best experience.
</Tip>

### Debugging

You can debug your codemods like any other Python code:

1. Set breakpoints in your codemod implementation
2. Use the IDE's debug configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Debug Codemod",
     "type": "python",
     "request": "launch",
     "program": "${workspaceFolder}/.codegen/codemods/organize_types/organize_types.py",
     "console": "integratedTerminal"
   }
   ```
3. Or run with the Python debugger:
   ```bash
   python -m pdb .codegen/codemods/organize_types/organize_types.py
   ```



## Cursor-Specific Features

When using Codegen with Cursor:

1. The AI chat window can read your system prompt from `.codegen/codemods/your_codemod/your_codemod-system-prompt.txt`
2. This helps the AI understand your codemod's purpose and provide better suggestions
3. You can ask the AI to help you:
   - Debug issues in your codemod
   - Suggest improvements to your implementation
   - Understand how to use specific Codegen APIs

<Note>
The system prompt is automatically generated when you use `codegen create` with the `-d` flag.
</Note>

## Best Practices

1. **Use Type Hints**: They improve IDE support and catch errors early
   ```python
   def process_function(function: codegen.Function) -> None:
       # Your code here
   ```

2. **Leverage IDE Features**: 
   - Use "Go to Definition" to explore the Codegen API
   - Use "Find References" to see how APIs are used
   - Use the debugger for complex transformations

3. **Iterative Development**:
   ```bash
   # Create your codemod
   codegen create my-codemod -d "description"
   
   # Make changes and test with a preview
   codegen run my-codemod --diff-preview 50
   
   # Once satisfied, run without preview
   codegen run my-codemod
   ```

## Common IDE Issues

1. **Missing Autocompletion**
   - Ensure `codegen` is installed in your Python environment
   - Check that your IDE is using the correct Python interpreter

2. **Debugger Not Working**
   - Verify your launch configuration points to the correct file
   - Make sure you're running the codemod script directly, not through `codegen run`

3. **System Prompt Not Found**
   - Check that the prompt file exists in your codemod directory
   - Ensure you used `-d` when creating the codemod
